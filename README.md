# fCC_Data-Visualization
Here are some of my "Data Visualization" Projects on freeCodeCamp

## 1. Bar Chart
- **Introduction**: This is my first data visualization project. And I really enjoyed it when I finished it. Just a few lines of code to create a beautiful chart
- **Skills**: D3.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS.
- **Purposes**: Show the United States GDP data from 1947 to 2015.

## 2. Scatterplot Graph
- **Introduction**: In this project I was more familiar with using d3.js so the implementation was easy, notably having to change to "circle"
- **Skills**: D3.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS.
- **Purposes**: Show the doping in professional bicycle racing - 35 fastest times up Alpe d'Huez

## 3. Heat Map
- **Introduction**: This is the most beautiful project. I really like the color and the way the data is displayed. It's really cool.
